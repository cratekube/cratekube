# What is CrateKube?

CrateKube is a set of pluggable open source components that work together to manage Kubernetes deployments. Kubernetes makes it easy to manage containers, and CrateKube makes it easy to manage Kubernetes. The CrateKube project is sponsored by Cisco and is under active development. For more information about what the project can do, see the CrateKube homepage.﻿

# What is available now?

The CrateKube platform is rapidly approaching an MVP state that will allow one-click provisioning of Kubernetes clusters, interactive documentation, and the ability to mount NFS storage into application containers at runtime. For more information on the scope of the MVP, see the CrateKube MVP architecture﻿.

When the MVP has been completed, more usage information will be included on the releases page for the CrateKube repository.﻿ If you would like to stay connected with us before the initial release of the platform, please contact us at cratekube-contributors@cisco.com.

# What will CrateKube be in the future?

After the MVP release of the platform, CrateKube will gain additional features and functionality that go far beyond Kubernetes deployment automation. With this platform, we want to make it so easy to provision and operate a Kubernetes installation, that anyone can do it regardless of their level of experience with containers. Abstracting away the need for manual operations is the grander vision of CrateKube. We want to enable people to focus on building applications that provide business value instead of learning the inner workings of Kubernetes. Towards that goal, we have many features and enhancements planned for the future, such as:

  - Automated error handling and self-healing clusters
  - Enterprise SSO integration
  - Automated cluster upgrades
  - A custom UI
  - Built-in platform metrics
  - Default monitoring alerts
  - A catalog for one-click provisioning of CrateKube's integrations
  - Various enhancements to the existing CrateKube automation

This list of potential features is by no means exhaustive and is not prioritized. If you have an interest in any of these features contact us at cratekube-contributors@cisco.com to let us know. If you have an idea for a feature, open an issue on the CrateKube repository﻿ to begin a discussion with the CrateKube maintainers.

# What does it mean for this project to be Cisco-sponsored?

For this project, Cisco-sponsorship means that a team within Cisco is dedicated to ensuring the continued success and maintenance of this project. We are investing in this solution because we believe it has the potential to be something great. Community input, feedback, and contribution will help drive the direction of platform.
