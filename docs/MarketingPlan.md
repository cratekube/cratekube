# CrateKube Marketing
_The first steps towards marketing a feature rich, default-secure, auto-managed Kubernetes platform that anyone can use._

## Executive Summary
This document is the first iteration of a potential marketing plan for the CrateKube platform that will encompass both internal and external marketing channels, the development of our unique selling proposition, and the steps necessary to build a community that is solidly engaged with our product.

## Audience
There are currently three audiences for this document:
- Cisco business units and engineering organizations providing feedback for the MVP
- Private sector customers who wish to understand our value proposition
- Open source contributors who seek details on the viability of our product

## Purpose
The underlying purpose of this document is to develop actionable steps for marketing the CrateKube product, gathering customer requirements, and further improving the roadmap of features that CrateKube will provide.  The outcome should achieve both the long-term objective of OSS community adoption, and the short-term objectives of providing value to customers within Cisco engineering organizations.

# MVaP
As CrateKube rapidly approaches a Minimum Valuable Product (MVaP) state, we are focusing primarily on internal adoption and beta testing.  However, our long-term objective is to provide a product that establishes an open-source, community-driven model, and a process for incubating other OSS projects throughout Cisco.

### Value proposition
- Create a comprehensive process for establishing open source software (OSS) projects within Cisco
- Provide API-driven (headless) one-click deployments for Kubernetes clusters on AWS
- Provide AutoFS support for Kubernetes deployments in the most simple and secure way possible
- Provide automatic upgrade capabilities for CrateKube deployments

### Target Customers
- For MVaP our target customer base will be strictly internal engineering organizations

### Core Features
The following areas are identified in our [requirements document](https://github.com/cratekube/cratekube/blob/master/docs/Requirements.md) as explicitly MVaP:

##### Elastic provisioning
- Resource allocation in 5 minutes or less
- External cloud accessibility / AWS

##### Tenancy Isolation
- Environments are separated from other tenants

##### Persistent storage
- NFS storage access using AutoFS

##### Docs
- Developer Documentation
- Contributor Documentation

### Marketing channels
- [ ] Create a CrateKube mailer
- [ ] Create a WebexTeams channel and Gitter channel
- [ ] Create a CrateKube website that links to the above and outlines the features of the product
- [ ] Create open-source repositories for each microservice
- [ ] Create a "CrateKube" repository for general project details and contributor information

### Engagement Strategy
- [ ] Set up a system to track internal customers and beta testers
- [ ] Set up regular consultations with existing Crate customers to drive requirements for CrateKube
- [ ] Partner with technical leads across sister groups to drive integrations and participation

# Post MVaP

### Marketing Strategy
- [ ] Create case studies and use-cases for the product
- [ ] Create video-gifs showcasing the ease of deployment
- [ ] Proliferate content through mailers and public-facing chat rooms
- [ ] Focus on using keyword-rich content that will be picked up organically in search engines
- [ ] Set up a forum for users to discuss the platform and their experiences with it


### Engagement Strategy
- [ ] Partner with existing open-source projects by writing integrations into products such as CoreDNS
- [ ] Establish connections with talent by cross-pollinating development efforts on established projects 
- [ ] Develop a user experience program that takes a reactive approach to user feedback
- [ ] Become adopted as a sandbox project by CNCF or the Apache Software Foundation podlings
