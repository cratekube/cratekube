We strive as maintainers and contributors to uphold certain values for our project, [CrateKube](https://github.com/cratekube/cratekube). We've spelled this out in a handy-dandy acronym: **CREATIVE**.  We strive for our team to be [Collaborative](#Collaborative), [Respectful](#Respectful), [Efficient](#Efficient), [Accountable](#Accountable), [Transparent](#Transparent), [Iterative](#Iterative), deliver outstanding [Value](#Value), and be as [Effective](#Effective) as possible.  Creativity is the juice that keeps us flowing.

# Collaborative
Being helpful to other members of the team is paramount.  If someone asks for help with the project, we should always provide guidance in our respective areas of expertise.  

### Assume Good Intent
Always assume that the contributors and maintainers of this project have good intentions.  Toxic conversations happen mostly from the lack of emojis and bad faith.

### Trust but verify
Everything that goes into a release must be code reviewed, and quality assurance is always provided by persons _not_ on the review.  If code is merged and Q&A finds some small edits, open a separate issue for them.  Always trust that people are finding the right solutions, but verify they are being implemented correctly.

# Respectful
Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

### No ego
Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.

# Efficient

### Use well-established design patterns
The speed of innovation for our project is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. 

### Use popular and stable technology
Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.

### Be concise
Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by many, but only if it is short and to the point.  Provide TLDR summaries where possible.

# Accountable

### Take ownership of the work you do
Whether you are doing code-level design or documentation, it's best to take ownership and work with others to find solutions to problems you identify proactively.

# Transparent

We aren't transparent for the sake of being transparent, we are an open source endeavor that embraces diversity and inclusion.  By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. We use public github for issue tracking, code, and releases, and [reviewable.io](https://reviewable.io) for reviews.  We strive to make everything public that we can.

# Iterative

Perhaps the most important of our values is keeping the development cycle short.  The maintainers of this project use one week Agile sprints, for example.  This is so we can fail-fast and pivot quicker than other groups.  

# Valuable

Delivering value is something that is incredibly important if you want your project to be successful.  That's why we carefully craft our MVaP requirements and spend time listening to customers.  If the product you end up with delivers features that people don't need, then it's time to reassess your development path and iterate quickly to get back on track.

# Effective
This value is broad, and it is meant to be.  Being effective at inflencing others, writing good code, leaving good reviews, and being a compassionate human being are all good examples.  

### Be inquisitive
Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate channel.

### Be focused 
Focus on a single area where you know you can make the most impact.  Don't be afraid to seek out advice if your are not the subject matter expert.

### Give feedback effectively
Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
