# Crate Contribution Guidelines

We aim to make becoming a Crate contributor a simple and easy process. The following guidelines help to get you up and running with Crate contributions as quickly as possible.

## Contribution Process

1. Choose an issue to work on.
2. Fork the repository containing the project you'd like to contribute to.
3. Develop the feature or fix the bug you've chosen to work on. Be sure to include tests.
4. Update the documentation, including the repository's README.md, as necessary.
5. Ensure that tests are passing and the project builds.
6. Open a pull request with your changes against master. Review our PR creation guidelines. 
7. Wait for reviewers. You will likely need to make some changes after the code review.
8. Once the reviews pass, we will merge your pull request.

## Local Development

Each repository includes a README that will provide instructions on how to build and run the code locally.

## Feature Requests and Bugs

Search our existing issues for feature requests and bugs. If one doesn't already exist for your feature or bug, create a new one.
